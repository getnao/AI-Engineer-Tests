**Description:** Use Case Adoption Scoring data. This model contains all Use Case Adoption Scores, the metrics that those scores are based on, and identifying fields for the Account, Subscription, and Instance. This model is used for Use Case Adoption reporting/analysis, Platform Value reporting/analysis, Data Coverage reporting/analysis, and populating Gainsight Scorecard values. 

**Data Grain:** 1 row of usage data per instance_identifier, per snapshot_month. That row of data will be from the ping with the greatest ping_created_at value in each given snapshot_month

- primary_key

**Filters Applied to Model:** 

- license_user_count <> 0
- greatest ping_created_at value for each instance_identifier per snapshot_month

**Business Logic in this Model:** 

- Each instance must be associated with a subscription and sending usage data in order to be included in this table
- More detail about Calculations, Thresholds and Methodology can be found on this [Handbook Page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/customer-success/product-usage-data/use-case-adoption/)
- If a usage metric is not available for any reason, the score that uses that Metric is set to null to prevent that instance from incorrectly being marked as Red


**Other Comments:** 

- Use Case Adoption Scores are calcualted for all instances showing in this table regardless of instance_type. For reporting and analysis the filter WHERE instance_type = 'Production' must be used for accurate results
- For subscriptions with multiple Production instances a primary instance will need to be selected. This is commonly done with a QUALIFY statement that chooses the Production instance with the highest billable_user_count per delivery_type, per dim_subscription_id_original. (QUALIFY ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY snapshot_month, dim_subscription_id_original, delivery_type ORDER BY billable_user_count desc nulls last, ping_created_at desc nulls last) = 1)
    - This is especially important when joining this table to mart_arr so that subscription ARR amounts are not counted multiple times
- When joining this table to mart_arr the join should be: ON arr_month = snapshot_month AND dim_subscription_id_original = dim_subscription_id_original AND product_delivery_type = delivery_type followed by the QUALIFY statement mentioned above
- If additional usage metrics are needed for analysis beyond the metrics in this table the PROD.common_mart_product.mart_product_usage_paid_user_metrics_monthly table can be joined using the primary_key field on both tables for a 1 to 1 match.
