  - name: rpt_retention_future_parent_account
    description: Report table to support Net Dollar Retention analysis at the ultimate_parent_account level using the following year's parent account. This model is built on top of rpt_delta_arr_parent_month_8th_calendar_day. We have added report_retention_fiscal_quarter_name_fy and report_retention_fiscal_year as columns that allow seamless data filtering in Tableau. Teport_retention_fiscal_quarter_name_fy will populate a value in every row where retention_month is the third month of the quarter - except in the current quarter, where it will populate the current month. Report_retention_fiscal_year similarly will populate only for the last month of the year, except in the current year where it will populate a value only for rows where the retention_month is the current month. The non-report fields will only populate values for the third month of the quarter / last month of the year, which does not account for the live data that is accessible in the current month of the year.
