# NAII — it's nao AI interview

This repository contains an exercice with multiple parts that is given to candidates for the AI engineer interview at nao Labs.

## Part 1 — Add number to a column in a CSV



## Part 2 — Search a needle in a haystack

In the part you are asked to make search working on top of a LLM. There is a folder src/, in this folder the user would like to search for a specific column definition by prompting the LLM. You have to implement what it takes to make this search working.

The user will prompt exactly this:

```
I want to find where the total revenue is defined in the src folder. Return the SQL queries that are used to compute this revenue.
```
