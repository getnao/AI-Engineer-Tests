{% docs rpt_delta_arr_parent_month_8th_calendar_day %}

This report provides the 8th calendar day snapshot for the mart_delta_arr_parent_month table. It uses the rpt_delta_arr_parent_month_8th_calendar_day to build the table.

Custom Business Logic:

1. The parent/child crm account hierarchy changes on a monthly basis. The ARR snapshot table captures the account hierarchy on the 8th calendar day. When doing month over month calcs, this can result in accounts showing as churn in the snapshot data, but in reality, they just changed account hierarchies and did not churn. Therefore, we use the live crm account hierarchy in this model to remove the error that results from looking at snapshot account hierarchies.

2. We started snapshotting the product ranking in August 2022. Therefore, we have to use the live product ranking to backfill the data. In the future, this can be refined to use a dim_product_detail snapshot table when it is built.

{% docs rpt_crm_opportunity_renewal %}

This report model focuses exclusively on filtering out Renewal Opportunities from `mart_crm_opportunity`.

{% enddocs %}


{% docs rpt_crm_opportunity_open %}

This report model focuses exclusively on filtering out all Open Opportunities from `mart_crm_opportunity`.

{% enddocs %}

{% docs rpt_stage_progression %}

This report provides a detailed timeline for each opportunity, including when it entered each stage, the duration it stayed in each stage, and its final outcome (Won, Lost, or Open).

Each row represents a unique opportunity, recording the dates it entered each stage and the duration spent in each stage.

- STAGE_CATEGORY indicates the final status ("Won", "Open" or "Lost").
- CREATED_DATE is when the opportunity was created.
- CREATE_DAYS shows the time from creation to the first stage.
- For each stage (STAGE0 to STAGE7), the report includes the entry date and days spent in that stage.
- CLOSE_DATE marks when the opportunity was closed.
- CURRENT_DAYS tracks how long an open opportunity has remained in its current stage.

{% docs rpt_pipeline_coverage_daily_normalised_180_days %}

This report table is an updated version of rpt_pipeline_coverage_daily that adds support for future Close Quarters and extends the Snapshot Normalized Days range to 180 days (-90 to +90 Days).
Unlike rpt_pipeline_coverage and rpt_pipeline_coverage_daily, it uses Close Fiscal Quarters as the primary date axis.

{% enddocs %}

{% docs rpt_pipeline_coverage_daily %}

This report table simplifies tracking sales performance by showing targets and actuals combined. 
It combines daily targets, daily actuals along with the total quarterly targets and actuals. The daily actuals come from the snapshot data, whereas the quarterly actuals
come from the live data. This is because there are many deals are closed on the last day of the quarter but are not settled until a few days into the new quarter.
This model includes both the numerator and denominator for calculating coverage throughout a quarter.
This model is designed for users to use Snapshot Quarters as the primary date axis.

{% enddocs %}

{% docs rpt_targets_actuals_multi_grain_daily %}

This report table is an updated version of rpt_targets_actuals_multi_grain, supporting daily data updates for the Pipeline, Coverage, and Bookings Dashboard in Tableau instead of weekly (7-day interval) reporting.

{% enddocs %}

{% docs rpt_sales_clari_net_arr_forecast %}

This model combines Clari Net ARR forecast data from multiple sources. It joins forecast entries with user information, field definitions and time frame data, ensuring only the latest forecast entry per user is kept. The model then unions this with historical forecast data to maintain a complete historical record. 

{% enddocs %}

{% docs rpt_crm_opportunity_bookings_snapshot %}

This report model provides a combined view of bookings metrics from the snapshot model (`mart_crm_opportunity_daily_snapshot`) for past quarters and from the live model (`mart_crm_opportunity`) for current and recent quarters where quarter-end closing is not yet complete.

For past quarters (completed):
Uses snapshot data from the third business day of the following quarter.
This timing ensures we capture all bookings adjustments made during quarter-end closing processes.
Applies a filter to only include opportunities that were scheduled to close in that specific quarter.

For current and recent quarters (in progress):
Uses live data from `mart_crm_opportunity` for:
- The current fiscal quarter (always)
- The previous fiscal quarter (only if we haven't yet reached the third business day of the current quarter)
This provides up-to-date bookings information while quarter-end closing processes are still ongoing.

Bookings perspective:
When examining historical quarters, the model looks at opportunities that were expected to close in each quarter (based on their `close_fiscal_quarter_name`). This ensures bookings are attributed to the correct reporting period.
